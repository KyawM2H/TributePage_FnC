      U Thant , who served as Secretary-General of the United Nations from 1961
      to 1971, was chosen to head the world body when Secretary-General Dag
      Hammarskjold was killed in an air crash in September 1961. U Thant was
      born at Pantanaw, Burma, on 22 January 1909, and was educated at the
